[Code compiles and works with Eclipse and GWT 4/27/2018]

Software for instruction in logic (as used on http://softoption.us ). 
This is the source code for the Lambda Widget, which is some javascript 
for displaying proofs in lambda calculus. The Widget illustrates intelligent editing of 
derivations, and tactics. The code is written in Java and the project hosted and 
developed in the Eclipse IDE (Oxygen 3a), with GIT and the Google Web Toolkit (GWT 2.8.1) plug-in. The 
GWT plug-in can run the project in Super Dev mode for development. Then it compiles the 
Java to Javascript, which can be embedded in Web Pages (or ePubs, iBooks etc.). 
Various 'switches' in those Web Pages allow the Lambda Widget to be configured. 
Sample Web pages are included.
